# ConvergeConf

## About the Conference
Today, Technology is advancing rapidly and so is its implementation. With its agile nature, comes the need to harbor the skills required to use this technology and at the same time be aware of it. Several websites, online forums, videos, etc. are available online to help one out on their quest to learn new technology, but nothing comes close to the way in which a conference can contribute to the development of new skills. But conferences are generally confined to major metropolitan cities and are inaccessible by towns and parts of rural India. Converge Conf is here to change this very notion and bolster students to rise, create and excel in their careers.

We bring to you a conference which primarily focuses on offering exposure, and at the same time provides the right resources to hit the ground running while discovering new and exciting technologies. It is carefully crafted to give one a wholesome experience and introduce all the major paths of Computer Science, to help them decide which path they would be most comfortable taking. But that’s not all, the conference will also act as a medium to interact with students of various colleges and build a community of lifetime learners.  

Converge Conf promises two-days of enriching experiences and an experiment based learning that will heighten your understanding of essential CS concepts. It will create a platform for students to interact with eminent personalities from diverging fields and also enable them to showcase their talent.  Join us from the 15th to 16th of December as we take you on a journey to explore technologies from scratch.
