		<h1>Invitation to New Speakers</h1>
		<p>Today, technology is advancing rapidly and so is its implementation. Part of this advancement, is a new approach that has been gaining ground lately to help build awareness about the latest technologies; Conferences. This new gimmick is responsible for changing the lives of several students in major cities and is helping them harbor skills which they inturn use to contribute back to the growth. But the conferences are flawed due to their failure in providing the same kind of opportunities to the students living in towns and other parts of rural areas. </p>
		<p>ConvergeConf is here to change this and you can be a part of it as well. ConvergeConf is a conference which primarily focuses on offering exposure, and at the same time provides the right resources to help students hit the ground running while discovering new and exciting technologies. It is a single-track event that is being conducted from the <strong>15th – 16th of December in Kakinada</strong>.</p>
